# SUBIT‑64 Fractal  
Fractal Expansion of TETRAKSIS into the 64‑State Semantic Grid

SUBIT‑64 is a fractal expansion of the four TETRAKSIS bigrams.  
TETRAKSIS provides the **seed**; SUBIT‑64 is the **full bloom**.  
This document defines the canonical fractal logic that transforms:

TETRAKSIS (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 nodes)  
into  
SUBIT‑64 (4 × 4 × 4 = 64 states).

## 1. Fractal Principle

SUBIT fractality is not multiplication — it is **unfolding**.

- TETRAKSIS defines four bigrams  
- Each bigram becomes a dimension  
- Three dimensions generate a 4×4×4 cube  
- The cube contains 64 unique semantic states  

The fractal rule is:

```
SUBIT-64 = BIGRAM × BIGRAM × BIGRAM
```

Where each BIGRAM ∈ {10, 11, 01, 00}.

## 2. TETRAKSIS as the Fractal Seed

TETRAKSIS Level 4 provides the four canonical bigrams:

| Bigram | Person | Direction | Season |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| 10 | ME   | EAST  | SPRING |
| 11 | WE   | SOUTH | SUMMER |
| 01 | YOU  | WEST  | AUTUMN |
| 00 | THEY | NORTH | WINTER |

These four nodes form the **semantic alphabet** of the fractal.

## 3. Three‑Axis Expansion

SUBIT‑64 uses three axes:

1. **Person axis** (A)  
2. **Direction axis** (B)  
3. **Season axis** (C)  

Each axis is a copy of the TETRAKSIS bigram set.

Thus:

```
A ∈ {10, 11, 01, 00}
B ∈ {10, 11, 01, 00}
C ∈ {10, 11, 01, 00}
```

The fractal expansion is:

```
TETRAKSIS^3 = 4^3 = 64 states
```

---

## 4. Fractal Geometry

The SUBIT‑64 grid is a **semantic cube**:

```
Dimension 1: Person     (4 states)
Dimension 2: Direction  (4 states)
Dimension 3: Season     (4 states)
```

Each coordinate is a unique combination:

```
(A, B, C)
```

This cube is the fractal expansion of the TETRAKSIS tetrad.

## 5. Fractal Encoding Rule

The canonical encoding rule is:

```
SUBIT(A, B, C) =
  Person(A)
  Direction(B)
  Season(C)
```

Example:

```
SUBIT = 11 01 10
= WE / WEST / SPRING
```

Each coordinate is a **fractal echo** of the original TETRAKSIS structure.

## 6. Fractal Symmetry and Asymmetry

### Symmetry
- All three axes use the same four bigrams  
- The cube is perfectly regular  
- The structure is mathematically uniform  

### Asymmetry
- Each bigram carries unique semantic tension  
- Person, direction, and season are not interchangeable  
- Meaning emerges from **asymmetric content in symmetric form**

This is the core of SUBIT aesthetics.

## 7. Fractal Flow

The 64 states can be traversed as:

- cycles  
- spirals  
- layers  
- quadrants  
- developmental sequences  
- evolutionary genomes  

The fractal structure supports multiple interpretive flows.

## 8. Relation to Human Evolution Genome

The Human Evolution Genome uses SUBIT‑64 as:

- a developmental timeline  
- a civilizational cycle  
- a subjective–spatial–temporal evolution map  

Each evolutionary phase corresponds to one SUBIT coordinate.

The genome is provided in:

```
genomes/human-evolution-genome.md
```

## 9. Formal Fractal Definition

```
SUBIT-64 = {
  (A, B, C) |
  A ∈ {10, 11, 01, 00},
  B ∈ {10, 11, 01, 00},
  C ∈ {10, 11, 01, 00}
}
```

Where each bigram is defined by TETRAKSIS.
