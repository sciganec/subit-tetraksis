# SUBIT‑64 Table  
Full 64‑State Semantic Grid Derived from TETRAKSIS

This document provides the complete canonical SUBIT‑64 table.  
Each state is a 6‑bit configuration composed of three TETRAKSIS bigrams:

A = Person  
B = Direction  
C = Season  

Each bigram ∈ {10, 11, 01, 00}.  
Thus:

4 persons × 4 directions × 4 seasons = 64 states.

Every row below lists:

SUBIT code → Person / Direction / Season
