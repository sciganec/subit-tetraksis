# TETRAKSIS — Levels  
Canonical Description of All Four Structural Levels

This document provides a clean, minimal, canonical breakdown of the four levels of TETRAKSIS.  
Each level expands the ontological structure from unity → polarity → orientation → bigram expression.  
Together, the four levels form the semantic engine that powers SUBIT‑64.

---

## 1. Level 1 — Monad  
### **Node Count:** 1  
### **Function:** Undifferentiated origin

**Nodes:**
- **∞ — Nameless**  
  The pre‑differentiated whole; the source of all axes, distinctions, and semantic directions.

**Role:**  
The Monad establishes the ground state of the system — pure potential without structure.

---

## 2. Level 2 — Dyad  
### **Node Count:** 2  
### **Function:** Binary polarity

**Nodes:**
- **0 — Anima**  
  Receptive, inward, latent pole.
- **1 — Animus**  
  Active, outward, formative pole.

**Role:**  
The Dyad introduces the first distinction and defines the fundamental SUBIT polarity.  
It is the semantic root of binary encoding.

---

## 3. Level 3 — Triad  
### **Node Count:** 3  
### **Function:** Orienting questions

**Nodes:**
- **WHAT** — Essence, identity, event  
- **WHERE** — Spatial orientation, direction, placement  
- **WHEN** — Temporal orientation, cycle, phase  

**Role:**  
The Triad establishes the three axes of orientation that SUBIT‑64 later expresses in full resolution.  
It transforms polarity into navigable semantic space.

## 4. Level 4 — Tetrad  
### **Node Count:** 4  
### **Function:** Bigram answers (SUBIT bigram base)

**Nodes (canonical mapping):**

| Bigram | Person | Direction | Season |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| **10** | ME     | EAST      | SPRING |
| **11** | WE     | SOUTH     | SUMMER |
| **01** | YOU    | WEST      | AUTUMN |
| **00** | THEY   | NORTH     | WINTER |

**Role:**  
The Tetrad provides the four canonical SUBIT bigrams.  
These bigrams form the semantic alphabet from which the full 64‑state SUBIT grid is generated.

## Summary Table

```
Level 1: 1 node  → Monad      → ∞
Level 2: 2 nodes → Dyad       → 0, 1
Level 3: 3 nodes → Triad      → WHAT, WHERE, WHEN
Level 4: 4 nodes → Tetrad     → 10, 11, 01, 00
```

---

## Canonical Function of Levels

- **Monad** — establishes wholeness  
- **Dyad** — introduces polarity  
- **Triad** — defines orientation  
- **Tetrad** — expresses orientation as bigrams  

Together, these levels form the minimal structure capable of generating the full SUBIT‑64 ontology.

## Status

This document defines the canonical level structure for SUBIT‑TETRAKSIS v1.0.
