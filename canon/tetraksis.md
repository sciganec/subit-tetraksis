# TETRAKSIS  
Canonical 4‑Level, 10‑Node Structure

TETRAKSIS is the foundational ontological scaffold of the SUBIT system.  
It defines a minimal, symmetric geometric form with intentionally asymmetric semantic content — the core of SUBIT aesthetics.  
This document provides the canonical specification of all four levels and ten nodes.

---

## 1. Overview

TETRAKSIS consists of four hierarchical levels:

1. Monad — undifferentiated unity  
2. Dyad — binary polarity  
3. Triad — orienting questions  
4. Tetrad — bigram answers (SUBIT bigram base)

The structure expands from 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 nodes, forming a perfect triangular progression while encoding semantic asymmetry.

## 2. Level 1 — Monad of Wholeness

### Node 1  
- **Symbol:** ∞  
- **Name:** Nameless  
- **Meaning:**  
  The undivided origin; pre‑differentiated wholeness; the source of all axes and distinctions.

---

## 3. Level 2 — Dyad of Opposites

### Node 1  
- **Symbol:** 0  
- **Name:** Anima  
- **Meaning:**  
  Receptive, inward, latent pole.

### Node 2  
- **Symbol:** 1  
- **Name:** Animus  
- **Meaning:**  
  Active, outward, formative pole.

The Dyad establishes the fundamental SUBIT polarity and the semantic ground for binary encoding.

---

## 4. Level 3 — Triad of Questions

### Node 1  
- **Label:** WHAT  
- **Meaning:**  
  Essence, identity, event.

### Node 2  
- **Label:** WHERE  
- **Meaning:**  
  Spatial orientation, direction, placement.

### Node 3  
- **Label:** WHEN  
- **Meaning:**  
  Temporal orientation, cycle, phase.

The Triad defines the three axes of orientation that SUBIT‑64 later expresses in full resolution.

## 5. Level 4 — Tetrad of Answers (SUBIT Bigrams)

The fourth level provides the four canonical SUBIT bigrams.  
Each bigram encodes a **person**, **direction**, and **season** — forming the semantic alphabet of SUBIT‑64.

| Bigram | Person | Direction | Season |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| **10** | ME     | EAST      | SPRING |
| **11** | WE     | SOUTH     | SUMMER |
| **01** | YOU    | WEST      | AUTUMN |
| **00** | THEY   | NORTH     | WINTER |

### Interpretation

- **Person axis:** ME / WE / YOU / THEY  
- **Spatial axis:** EAST / SOUTH / WEST / NORTH  
- **Seasonal axis:** SPRING / SUMMER / AUTUMN / WINTER  

These four bigrams form the complete 2‑bit semantic space and serve as the generative base for SUBIT‑64.

## 6. Formal Definition

```
TETRAKSIS = {
  L1: [∞],
  L2: [0, 1],
  L3: [WHAT, WHERE, WHEN],
  L4: [
    (10, ME,   EAST,  SPRING),
    (11, WE,   SOUTH, SUMMER),
    (01, YOU,  WEST,  AUTUMN),
    (00, THEY, NORTH, WINTER)
  ]
}
```

---

## 7. Role in SUBIT

TETRAKSIS functions as:

- the **bigram base** of SUBIT‑64,  
- the **semantic coordinate system** for subject–space–time,  
- the **fractal seed** from which the 64‑state grid unfolds,  
- the **canonical mask** for SUBIT interpretation and modeling.

It is the minimal structure capable of generating the full SUBIT ontology.

## 8. Status

This document defines the canonical TETRAKSIS specification for SUBIT‑TETRAKSIS v1.0.
