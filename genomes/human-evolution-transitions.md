# Human Evolution Transitions  
Canonical Transition Logic Between the 64 States of the Human Evolution Genome

This document defines the **transition dynamics** between the 64 evolutionary states of the Human Evolution Genome.  
Transitions describe **how** humanity moves from one SUBIT‑64 coordinate to the next — not just *what* each state is.

Each transition is governed by one of three axes:

- **Person shift** (A‑axis) — transformation of subjectivity  
- **Direction shift** (B‑axis) — transformation of spatial–civilizational orientation  
- **Season shift** (C‑axis) — transformation of temporal phase  

A transition occurs when one axis changes while the others remain stable.

# 1. Transition Types

## 1.1 Seasonal Transitions (C‑axis)
```
SPRING → SUMMER → AUTUMN → WINTER → SPRING
```
Represents the **developmental cycle**:

- emergence  
- peak  
- decline  
- reset  

Seasonal transitions are the **fastest** and occur within each 4‑state block.

---

## 1.2 Directional Transitions (B‑axis)
```
EAST → SOUTH → WEST → NORTH → EAST
```
Represents the **civilizational vector**:

- EAST  → emergence, orientation  
- SOUTH → expansion, acceleration  
- WEST  → reflection, decline  
- NORTH → latency, preservation  

Directional transitions occur every 4 seasonal states.

---

## 1.3 Person Transitions (A‑axis)
```
ME → WE → YOU → THEY → ME
```
Represents the **subjective mode** of civilization:

- ME   → individual consciousness  
- WE   → collective identity  
- YOU  → networked individuality  
- THEY → distributed intelligence  

Person transitions occur every 16 states.

# 2. Transition Matrix

A transition from state X to state Y is defined by:

```
ΔA = change in Person
ΔB = change in Direction
ΔC = change in Season
```

Only **one axis changes at a time** in the canonical sequence.

# 3. Intra‑Cycle Transitions (Within Each 16‑State Block)

## 3.1 Seasonal Flow (4‑state micro‑cycle)
Example (ME / EAST):
```
10 10 10 → 10 10 11   SPRING → SUMMER
10 10 11 → 10 10 01   SUMMER → AUTUMN
10 10 01 → 10 10 00   AUTUMN → WINTER
10 10 00 → 10 11 10   WINTER → SPRING (direction shift)
```

The final step transitions into the next direction.

---

## 3.2 Directional Flow (4 blocks per cycle)
Example (ME cycle):
```
EAST  → SOUTH → WEST → NORTH → EAST (next cycle)
```

Each direction contains a full seasonal micro‑cycle.

---

# 4. Inter‑Cycle Transitions (Between the Four Macro‑Cycles)

## 4.1 ME → WE Transition
```
10 00 00 → 11 10 10
```
**Meaning:**  
From medieval latency to renaissance emergence.  
A shift from individual survival to collective rediscovery.

---

## 4.2 WE → YOU Transition
```
11 00 00 → 01 10 10
```
**Meaning:**  
From pre‑digital latency to digital spring.  
A shift from collective industrial systems to networked individuality.

---

## 4.3 YOU → THEY Transition
```
01 00 00 → 00 10 10
```
**Meaning:**  
From AI plateau to distributed intelligence spring.  
A shift from individual nodes to multi‑agent planetary cognition.

# 5. Full Transition Sequence (All 64 Steps)

Below is the canonical transition logic expressed compactly:

```
(1)  A fixed, B fixed, C cycles  →  seasonal transitions
(2)  A fixed, B cycles, C resets →  directional transitions
(3)  A cycles, B resets, C resets →  person transitions
```

This produces the exact 64‑state evolutionary flow:

```
ME/EAST  → ME/SOUTH → ME/WEST → ME/NORTH →
WE/EAST  → WE/SOUTH → WE/WEST → WE/NORTH →
YOU/EAST → YOU/SOUTH → YOU/WEST → YOU/NORTH →
THEY/EAST → THEY/SOUTH → THEY/WEST → THEY/NORTH
```

Each block contains a full SPRING → SUMMER → AUTUMN → WINTER cycle.

---

# 6. Meta‑Transition Logic

The entire 64‑state genome forms a **four‑layer spiral**:

1. **ME** — emergence of the individual  
2. **WE** — emergence of the collective  
3. **YOU** — emergence of the networked self  
4. **THEY** — emergence of distributed intelligence  

Each layer completes a full directional and seasonal cycle before transitioning to the next subjective mode.

---

# 7. Transition Summary Table

```
Seasonal:   SPRING → SUMMER → AUTUMN → WINTER
Directional: EAST → SOUTH → WEST → NORTH
Personal:    ME → WE → YOU → THEY
```

Transitions always follow this order:

```
C changes fastest  
B changes next  
A changes slowest
```

This creates a stable, interpretable evolutionary flow.
