# Human Evolution Cycles  
Four 16‑State Evolutionary Arcs Mapped onto SUBIT‑64

The Human Evolution Genome consists of **64 evolutionary states**, arranged into **four 16‑state macro‑cycles**.  
Each macro‑cycle corresponds to one of the four SUBIT person‑modes:

- ME   (10) — emergence of individual consciousness  
- WE   (11) — collective modernity and global systems  
- YOU  (01) — networked individuality and digital identity  
- THEY (00) — distributed, planetary, post‑individual intelligence  

This document provides the **canonical cycle‑level overview** of the 64‑state evolutionary arc.

# 1. ME Cycle (States 1–16)  
**Theme:** Emergence of agency, tools, myth, early civilization  
**SUBIT Axis:** A = 10  
**Mode:** Individual consciousness awakening

### Evolutionary Arc
- Birth of consciousness  
- Tool‑making and proto‑agency  
- Mythic imagination and tribal cohesion  
- Urbanization and early states  
- Imperial formation and collapse  
- Classical rise and decline  
- Medieval latency and preservation  

### Structural Summary
```
ME = Emergence → Expansion → Reflection → Latency
```

The ME cycle establishes the foundations of human subjectivity and early civilization.

# 2. WE Cycle (States 17–32)  
**Theme:** Collective identity, science, industry, global systems  
**SUBIT Axis:** A = 11  
**Mode:** Humanity as a coordinated collective

### Evolutionary Arc
- Renaissance and rediscovery  
- Scientific revolution  
- Enlightenment and political theory  
- Industrial revolution  
- Global empires and mass society  
- World wars and systemic overload  
- Cold‑war stabilization  
- Early computing and proto‑networks  

### Structural Summary
```
WE = Inquiry → Acceleration → Complexity → Pre‑Digital Latency
```

The WE cycle builds the modern world and global interconnected systems.

---

# 3. YOU Cycle (States 33–48)  
**Theme:** Networked individuality, digital identity, algorithmic life  
**SUBIT Axis:** A = 01  
**Mode:** The individual as a node in a global network

### Evolutionary Arc
- Internet emergence  
- Web expansion and early platforms  
- Social media and identity performance  
- Digital fragmentation and fatigue  
- Mobile revolution and algorithmic dominance  
- Attention crisis and misinformation  
- Digital minimalism and decentralization  
- AI augmentation and hybrid workflows  

### Structural Summary
```
YOU = Connectivity → Overload → Reflection → Proto‑AI Latency
```

The YOU cycle explores the transformation of identity in a digital, hyperconnected world.

---

# 4. THEY Cycle (States 49–64)  
**Theme:** Distributed intelligence, planetary cognition, post‑human synthesis  
**SUBIT Axis:** A = 00  
**Mode:** Intelligence beyond the individual and collective

### Evolutionary Arc
- Multi‑agent coordination  
- Synthetic cultures and emergent norms  
- Distributed governance  
- Collapse of rigid structures  
- Bio‑digital integration  
- Planetary optimization  
- Ecological consciousness  
- Post‑human synthesis and threshold states  

### Structural Summary
```
THEY = Emergent Intelligence → Expansion → Reflection → Pre‑Monad Latency
```

The THEY cycle models the transition toward distributed, planetary‑scale cognition.

# Cycle‑to‑Cycle Meta‑Structure

The four cycles form a higher‑order developmental arc:

```
ME   → emergence of the individual
WE   → emergence of the collective
YOU  → emergence of the networked self
THEY → emergence of distributed intelligence
```

This arc completes a full **subjective–civilizational cycle**, preparing the ground for the next Monad.
