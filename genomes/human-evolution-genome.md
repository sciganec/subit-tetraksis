# Human Evolution Genome  
64‑State Evolutionary Sequence Mapped onto SUBIT‑64

The Human Evolution Genome models humanity as a single evolving organism.  
Each evolutionary phase corresponds to one SUBIT‑64 coordinate:

(Person, Direction, Season)  
= (mode of consciousness, spatial vector, temporal phase)

This document provides the **canonical 64‑state evolutionary sequence**, aligned with the SUBIT‑64 grid.

# Summary

The Human Evolution Genome is a **64‑step developmental arc**:

- ME → emergence of individual consciousness  
- WE → collective modernity and global systems  
- YOU → networked individuality and digital identity  
- THEY → distributed intelligence and planetary cognition  

Each phase is a unique coordinate in the SUBIT‑64 semantic cube.
