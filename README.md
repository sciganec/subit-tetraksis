# SUBIT‑TETRAKSIS  
Canonical Bigram Core for SUBIT‑64

SUBIT‑TETRAKSIS defines the foundational 4‑level, 10‑node structure that serves as the semantic and ontological core of the SUBIT‑64 system.  
It provides a minimal symmetric geometry with intentionally asymmetric meaning — the defining aesthetic of SUBIT.

This release introduces:
- the TETRAKSIS canonical structure,
- the SUBIT‑64 bigram mapping,
- and a full Human Evolution Genome as an applied example.

## 1. Overview

TETRAKSIS is a four‑level ontological scaffold:

1. Monad — undifferentiated unity  
2. Dyad — binary polarity  
3. Triad — orienting questions  
4. Tetrad — bigram answers (the SUBIT bigram base)

The fourth level provides the four canonical SUBIT bigrams, which expand fractally into the 64‑state SUBIT grid.

## 2. TETRAKSIS Structure

### Level 1 — Monad of Wholeness
- ∞ — Nameless  
  The undivided origin.

### Level 2 — Dyad of Opposites
- 0 — Anima  
- 1 — Animus  

Binary polarity; the root of SUBIT bit‑semantics.

### Level 3 — Triad of Questions
- WHAT  
- WHERE  
- WHEN  

Three axes of orientation: essence, space, time.

### Level 4 — Tetrad of Answers (SUBIT Bigrams)

| Bigram | Person | Direction | Season |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| 10 | ME   | EAST  | SPRING |
| 11 | WE   | SOUTH | SUMMER |
| 01 | YOU  | WEST  | AUTUMN |
| 00 | THEY | NORTH | WINTER |

These four bigrams form the semantic alphabet of SUBIT‑64.

## 3. SUBIT‑64 Mapping

SUBIT‑64 is constructed from three TETRAKSIS bigrams:

A = Person bigram  
B = Direction bigram  
C = Season bigram  

Each dimension has four possible states (10, 11, 01, 00), producing:

4 × 4 × 4 = 64 unique SUBIT states

Each SUBIT state encodes a subjective–spatial–temporal configuration.

Full mapping is provided in:
- subit64/subit64-map.md  
- subit64/subit64-table.md

---

## 4. Human Evolution Genome (Example Application)

The Human Evolution Genome demonstrates how SUBIT‑64 can model long‑scale civilizational dynamics.

Each of the 64 SUBIT states corresponds to:
- a mode of consciousness,
- a socio‑organizational pattern,
- a technological phase,
- a position in the civilizational cycle.

Example (first 4 states):

| SUBIT | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| 10‑10‑10 | Emergence of consciousness; early tools |
| 10‑10‑11 | Mythic flourishing; tribal culture |
| 10‑10‑01 | Urbanization; stratification |
| 10‑10‑00 | Collapse of early civilizations |

The full 64‑state genome is included in:
- genomes/human-evolution-genome.md
