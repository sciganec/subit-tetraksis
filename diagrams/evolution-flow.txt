Human Evolution Genome — Canonical 64‑Step Flow

Each step is one SUBIT‑64 state:
A A = Person   (10 ME, 11 WE, 01 YOU, 00 THEY)
B B = Direction (10 EAST, 11 SOUTH, 01 WEST, 00 NORTH)
C C = Season   (10 SPRING, 11 SUMMER, 01 AUTUMN, 00 WINTER)

Format:
[NN] AABBCC  PERSON / DIRECTION / SEASON — description

Flow rule:
C changes fastest → B next → A slowest

META‑FLOW SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------

ME (10)  → WE (11)  → YOU (01)  → THEY (00)  → next Monad (∞)

Within each 16‑state cycle:
• C (Season) cycles: SPRING → SUMMER → AUTUMN → WINTER  
• B (Direction) steps: EAST → SOUTH → WEST → NORTH  
• A (Person) shifts only after a full 16‑state arc
